Initial TPD Procedure
H on Si(100)
2010.07.06 12:50
1. TPD on bare Si(100) with clean chamber.
1.1. Flash Si sample to 1200C.
1.2. TPD
2. TPD on clean Si(100) with chamber exposed to atomic H.
2.1. Flash sample.
2.2. Remove sample from chamber.
2.3. Expose chamber to atomic H.
2.4. Put sample back in chamber.
2.5. TPD
3. TPD on hydrogen-pacified Si(100) sample.
3.1. Flash Si sample
3.2. Expose to atomic H
3.3. TPD
TPD Procedure:
1. Verify that TPD_Controller.vi is communicating properly with instruments (only on first run since program was started, sample should be disconnected from power supply).
1.1. Lakeshore temperature controller
1.2. Kepco power supply
1.3. Mikron pyrometer
2. Input controller parameters/metadata.
2.1. Metadata (all self-explanatory)
2.2. Maximum values
2.2.1. Maximum Current = 4 A
2.2.2. Maximum voltage = 20 V
2.2.3. Maximum temperature = 800 C
2.3. Temperature Schedule
2.3.1.    350C, 0s
2.3.2.    350C, 40s
2.3.3.    650C, 190s
2.4. Gain Schedule
2.4.1.    Kc = .003, Ti = .1, Td = .001, max Temp = 0C
2.4.2.    PID calculates current
3. Begin recording RGA data.
4. Start temperature ramp.
5. Save temperature and RGA data after experiment finishes.
