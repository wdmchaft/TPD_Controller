TPD Controller
The TPD Controller linearly ramps and holds the temperature of a sample through the use of a closed-loop control.  This involves measuring the temperature of the sample with a pyrometer, calculating the temperature error, and heating the sample resistively using a current calculated by a PID algorithm.  Data about time and temperature are recorded so that the temperature schedule can be compared with RGA data to perform temperature programmed desorptiion.
